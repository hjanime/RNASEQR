=========================================================================

We developed RNASEQR to align RNA-seq reads efficiently and to comprehensively discover both known and novel splice junctions. RNASEQR maps more reads while tolerates fewer mismatches, allows mapping reads on hyper-mutated genomic regions, and reduces significantly the false-positive SNV detection in the downstream analysis. Alignment result of RNASEQR can be reliably used to detect both annotated and novel exons and genes and to identify alternative splicing events and comprehensive gene structure present in the biological samples of interest.
